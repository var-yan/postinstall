  "description": "Replace 'Activities' button by all current workspaces buttons. Switch workspace or toggle overview by clicking on these buttons.\n\n You can use names for workspaces: there are two ways for that. 1) Edit the string array 'org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences.workspace-names' gsettings key (through dconf editor, e.g.). 2) Use official GNOME extension Workspaces Indicator's settings. You don't have to write a long enough list: numbers are displayed if no workspace name is defined.\n\nThis is a GNOME 45 compatible fork of https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3851/workspaces-bar/",
